Hi!

To help us gain experience working on projects as a team (and to focus on a wider variety of coding skills), The Tech Academy's Job Placement Director has created this repo for students' to collaborate on.  Its *overall* funcationality will be added to on a weekly basis, with optional coding opportunities included for an extra challenge.
