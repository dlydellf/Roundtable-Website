Hi!

To help us gain experience working on projects as a team (and to focus on a wider variety of coding skills), The Tech Academy's Job Placement Director has created this repo for students' to collaborate on.  Its *overall* funcationality will be added to on a weekly basis, with optional coding opportunities included for an extra challenge.

## 1st Week's Updates:
   - Functional Challenge(s)
     - [x] Update styles.css with a color palette; apply values throughout styles.css using var()
     - [x] Update main.js so challenge.html's "Clear" button works as expected
   - Coding Challenge(s)
     - [x] Check if a string can be formed from concatenating an array's contents.
